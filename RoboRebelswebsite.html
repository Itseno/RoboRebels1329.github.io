			and software engineering as well as team management (business, public relations, fundraising, safety).<br />
		</p>
	<h3>Benefits:</h3>
	
		<p>The opportunity to explore many aspects of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)<br /> 
			in a supportive environment where failure is a learning experience;<br />
